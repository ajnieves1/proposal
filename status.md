Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created a 3rd person movement controller with sprinting and jumping (animations for both), interactable grass, water shader, and camera system that responds to the player's mouse movement with collision detection.
The camera system also adjusts relative to the direction of the player. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I wanted to add NPC's, cutscenes when interacting with said NPC's, vehicle system, minigame system, and swimming system. No way I can get it all done by the deadline, maybe 1 or 2. However, I also want to prioritize a grabbing system as that would be a core mechanic.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The current problem I have is with the camera being relative to the player's direction. The camera system by itself works perfectly, but when I add the function that allows camera relativity, the player's movement is multiplied by an absurd number. I followed the documentation word for word but I can't figure out the problem. This problem also makes the animations become out of sync. For now, I'm just going to leave it in and prioritize prototyping other functionalities I find interesting and debug at a later time.
