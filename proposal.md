# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Most likely just "placeholder"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

3D adventure game prototype. I plan to work on this project after this class finishes so what I turn in for this will be a work in progress.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Prototype detailing various features, not sure specifically, but definitely climbing/gliding, animal AI, and cutscenes when interacting with other npc's.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

3D dynamic movement controller (smart grounded detection), cutscenes when interacting with characters in the scene (similar to Animal Crossing NH), water shaders, 
gliding system (similar to Wind Waker and BOTW gliders), prefab collection system (Banjo Kazooie ish), and basic level design with sound zones. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Implementing a climbing system, in addition to adding a 'stamina' feature to the gliding/climbing mechanic. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I plan on making additional mini games, such as catch, or collect certain number of items before a time limit. The mini game that requires another entity would need some sort of AI system which I would like to have made by the
deadline. Everything listed previously would work along wiht this.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn about creating AI system that interact with the player, animations, shader graphs, going in and out of 3d and 2d planes (like how in Little Big Planet you could go back and forward in a scene)
